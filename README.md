# Vehicle Maintenance Predictive System

## Overview

The **Vehicle Maintenance Predictive System** is designed to predict the maintenance needs of vehicles using machine learning algorithms. This system leverages various machine learning models including KMeans, Random Forest, SVM (Support Vector Machine), and XGBoost to analyze vehicle data and predict when maintenance is needed. The goal is to help vehicle owners and fleet managers perform proactive maintenance, reducing downtime and extending the lifespan of their vehicles.

## Features

- **Predictive Maintenance**: Uses machine learning algorithms to predict when a vehicle might need maintenance.
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Implements KMeans for clustering, Random Forest for classification, SVM for regression and classification, and XGBoost for enhanced performance and accuracy.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Analyzes vehicle data to provide insights into potential maintenance issues.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vehicle-maintenance-predictive-system.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd vehicle-maintenance-predictive-system
   ```

## Models Used

1. **KMeans**: Clustering algorithm to group similar vehicle data for preliminary analysis.
2. **Random Forest**: A versatile algorithm used for classification tasks to predict specific maintenance requirements.
3. **SVM (Support Vector Machine)**: Used for both regression and classification to determine the boundary between different classes of maintenance needs.
4. **XGBoost**: A gradient boosting framework optimized for speed and performance, used to enhance the accuracy of predictions.
